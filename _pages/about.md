I am a Ph.D. candidate in the cybersecurity group at Delft University of
Technology under the supervision of Dr. Stjepan Picek and Prof. Mauro Conti. My
research focuses on the security of AI and especially on backdoor attacks in
neural networks. Before that, I obtained my MSc. in Computer Engineering from
Delft University of Technology and my bachelor's in electrical and computer
engineering from National Technical University of Athens. I have also worked
several years in the industry in Greece and the Netherlands.
